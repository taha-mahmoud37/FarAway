###In this project, I used:

App Componemt contains all other component. 

Have been used:
- useState to manage component data
- Sorted Items in different 3 ways
    - By input default
    - By Description
    - By Packed
<br>

You can also Clear the Items through the clear button, and in this app, there are some variable that depends on the State so using a derived state instead of creating a new State like,
  - number of items 
  -  number of items packed

Have been used local storage to store data in your application .


Note: In the select option don't write items manually that have been used array.from and added length is 20 and map through it.

You can check that in the Froms Component to see it by yourself.
